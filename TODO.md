TODO
----

  - Get custom scrollbar for sidebar that doesn't use jquery.

  - Allow extra file types other than .md

  - Try serif fonts: Trykker, Merriweather
  
  - Deal with different screen sizes.

FEATURES
--------

  - Try out share.js for collaborative editing

  - Pressing f11 while on editor maximises editor

  - Maybe have a preview split pane. When editing, the preview should be
    scrolled to where you are editing. Also, when you click edit and arent at
    the top of the file, the editor should start so that the preview is in the
    same position as when you clicked edit.
